## Movie Recommendation Engine Development (Spark, Python, SQL)
- Designed system for movie platform to help 283k users get personalized recommendations based on MovieLens data
- Built ETL pipeline on Databricks to analyze over 100k movie rating data and conducted OLAP
- Based on collaborative Niltering, Alternative Least Square (ALS) model was implemented on the user-movie
matrix to reduce dimensionality and improve computational efficiency
- Used hyper-param tuning and cross-validation to generate the best model with 0.89 RMSE, 20% lower than the
untuned modelâ€¨
